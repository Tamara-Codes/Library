This time I used the holy trinity - HTML, CSS and JS!

I've learned about modal windows and saving input, and most importantly, using JS to dynamically create objects, a table in this case. 

There is still much to be done: 
1. Add a delete button for each book
2. Toggle read/not read for each book
3. Make it pretty!
